                <h2>Introduction to Elliptic Curves</h2>
                <p>An elliptic curve is a smooth, algebraic curve defined by an equation of the form:</p>
                <p><strong>y<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>3</sup> + ax + b</strong></p>
                <p>where a and b are constants, and the curve is non-singular (no cusps or self-intersections).</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Properties and Theorems of Elliptic Curves</h2>
                <h3>Group Structure</h3>
                <p>An important property of elliptic curves is their group structure. Points on an elliptic curve form
                    an abelian group under a geometrically defined addition operation.</p>

                <h3>Modularity Theorem (Taniyama-Shimura-Weil Conjecture)</h3>
                <p>The modularity theorem, proved by Andrew Wiles as a key part of his proof of Fermat's Last Theorem,
                    states that every elliptic curve defined over the rational numbers is modular. This deep result
                    connects elliptic curves with modular forms in number theory.</p>

                <h3>Mordell's Theorem</h3>
                <p>Mordell's theorem, also known as the Mordell-Weil theorem, states that the group of rational points
                    on an elliptic curve is finitely generated. This theorem plays a crucial role in the study of
                    Diophantine equations involving elliptic curves.</p>

                <h2>Applications of Elliptic Curves</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cryptography:</strong> Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is widely used for secure
                        communications, digital signatures, and key exchange protocols due to the difficulty of the
                        elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem.</li>
                    <li><strong>Factorization:</strong> Elliptic curves are used in algorithms for integer
                        factorization, such as Lenstra's elliptic curve factorization algorithm (ECM). ECM is
                        particularly effective against semiprimes, which are the product of two large prime numbers.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Number Theory:</strong> Elliptic curves provide a rich field of study for Diophantine
                        equations and have connections to deep conjectures and theorems in number theory, including
                        Fermat's Last Theorem and the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture.</li>

                <h2>Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)</h2>
                <p>Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) leverages the difficulty of solving the elliptic curve discrete
                    logarithm problem (ECDLP) for its security. Key features include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Key Exchange:</strong> ECC provides efficient key exchange mechanisms, such as
                        Diffie-Hellman key exchange and Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH), crucial for establishing
                        secure communication channels.</li>
                    <li><strong>Digital Signatures:</strong> ECC algorithms like Elliptic Curve Digital Signature
                        Algorithm (ECDSA) are used for signing messages and verifying their authenticity in a secure and
                        efficient manner.</li>
                    <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> ECC-based encryption schemes, such as Elliptic Curve Integrated
                        Encryption Scheme (ECIES), provide confidentiality and integrity for sensitive data.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Elliptic Curve Factorization (ECM)</h2>
                <p>Lenstra's elliptic curve factorization algorithm (ECM) is an efficient method for factoring integers,
                    particularly semiprimes, using the properties of elliptic curves:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Algorithm:</strong> ECM leverages the group structure of elliptic curves to find small
                        factors of integers by solving a sequence of elliptic curve discrete logarithm problems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> ECM is particularly effective against semiprimes, which are the
                        product of two large prime numbers, making it a valuable tool in cryptography and number theory.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Research and Further Developments</h2>
                <p>Research in elliptic curves continues to advance both theoretical understanding and practical
                    applications:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Advanced Cryptography:</strong> Continued research aims to enhance the security and
                        efficiency of ECC-based protocols, addressing potential vulnerabilities and improving
                        implementation practices.</li>
                    <li><strong>Algorithmic Innovations:</strong> New algorithms and optimizations for elliptic curve
                        operations, including point multiplication and scalar multiplication, contribute to faster and
                        more reliable cryptographic and computational methods.</li>
                    <li><strong>Conjectures and Theorems:</strong> Elliptic curves remain central to unsolved
                        conjectures in number theory, such as the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, which connects
                        the rank of elliptic curves to the behavior of their L-functions.</li>
