                <h2>Introduction to Algebraic Number Theory</h2>
                <p>Algebraic number theory is a branch of number theory that studies the arithmetic properties of
                    algebraic numbers, which are roots of polynomial equations with integer coefficients. It explores
                    the structure of number fields, their rings of integers, and extends concepts like prime
                    factorization to ideals in these fields.</p>
            </section>

                <h2>Theorems and Results</h2>

                <h3>Number Fields and Rings of Integers</h3>
                <p>Number fields are finite extensions of the rational numbers, often denoted as (K). Each number
                    field ( K ) has a corresponding ring of integers (mathcal{O}_K ), which generalizes the
                    concept of integers to these fields.</p>

                <h3>Ideal Theory</h3>
                <p>Ideal theory in algebraic number theory extends the concept of prime factorization from integers to
                    ideals within the ring of integers ( mathcal{O}_K ). The fundamental theorem of ideal theory
                    states that every nonzero ideal in ( mathcal{O}_K ) can be factored uniquely into a product of
                    prime ideals.</p>

                <h3>Class Field Theory</h3>
                <p>Class field theory connects number fields to abelian extensions, which are Galois extensions with
                    abelian Galois groups. It establishes a deep relationship between number fields and ideal class
                    groups through the use of ideles and the Artin reciprocity map.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Axioms and Methods</h2>
                <p>Algebraic number theory employs various axioms and methods to explore the properties of number fields
                    and their rings of integers:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Norms and Traces:</strong> These functions on elements of number fields play a crucial
                        role in defining the arithmetic behavior of these fields and their extensions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Discriminants and Ramification:</strong> The discriminant measures the extent of
                        "ramification" or complication of the field extension at prime ideals.</li>
                    <li><strong>Minkowski Bound:</strong> Provides an upper limit on the absolute value of the
                        discriminant of a number field in terms of its degree and regulator.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Applications</h2>
                <p>Algebraic number theory finds applications in various areas of mathematics and beyond:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Diophantine Equations:</strong> Uses algebraic methods to study equations with integer
                        solutions, such as the study of elliptic curves over number fields.</li>
                    <li><strong>Class Number and Units:</strong> Computes the class number of a number field, which
                        measures the failure of unique factorization, and studies units in number fields.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cryptography:</strong> Certain cryptographic protocols rely on the properties of number
                        fields and their rings of integers for security, such as those based on ideal lattices.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Future Directions</h2>
                <p>The future of algebraic number theory involves exploring more complex relationships and developing
                    computational tools:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Non-abelian Class Field Theory:</strong> Extending class field theory to non-abelian
                        Galois extensions to understand more intricate relationships between number fields and their
                        arithmetic properties.</li>
                    <li><strong>Computational Aspects:</strong> Developing efficient algorithms for computing with
                        number fields, including algorithms for computing class groups and units.</li>
                </ul>
