                <h2>Divisibility Rules</h2>
                <h3>Divisibility by 2</h3>
                <p>A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even (0, 2, 4, 6, 8).</p>

                <h3>Divisibility by 3</h3>
                <p>A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.</p>

                <h3>Divisibility by 4</h3>
                <p>A number is divisible by 4 if the number formed by its last two digits is divisible by 4.</p>

                <h3>Divisibility by 5</h3>
                <p>A number is divisible by 5 if it ends in 0 or 5.</p>

                <h3>Divisibility by 6</h3>
                <p>A number is divisible by 6 if it is divisible by both 2 and 3.</p>

                <h3>Divisibility by 7</h3>
                <p>To check if a number is divisible by 7, double the last digit and subtract it from the rest of the
                    number. If the result is divisible by 7, then so is the original number.</p>

                <h3>Divisibility by 8</h3>
                <p>A number is divisible by 8 if the number formed by its last three digits is divisible by 8.</p>

                <h3>Divisibility by 9</h3>
                <p>A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.</p>

                <h3>Divisibility by 11</h3>
                <p>A number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of its digits in odd positions and the
                    sum of its digits in even positions is divisible by 11.</p>

                <h1>Prime Number Theory</h1>

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Prime numbers are natural numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and
                    themselves. They play a fundamental role in number theory due to their distribution and properties.
                </p>

                <h2>Basic Definitions</h2>
                <p>A prime number is defined as a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two
                    smaller natural numbers. For example, 5 is prime because the only ways to write it as a product, 1 ×
                    5 or 5 × 1, involve 5 itself.</p>

                <h2>Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic</h2>
                <p>This theorem states that every integer greater than 1 is either a prime itself or can be factorized
                    into prime numbers, and this factorization is unique, apart from the order of the factors.</p>

                <h2>Sieve of Eratosthenes</h2>
                <p>The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an ancient algorithm used to find all primes up to a specified integer.
                    It works by iteratively marking the multiples of each prime starting from 2.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Initialize a list of numbers from 2 to n.</li>
                    <li>Start with the first number in the list (p=2).</li>
                    <li>Mark all multiples of p (2p, 3p, 4p, etc.) as non-prime.</li>
                    <li>Find the next number in the list that is not marked and repeat the process.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Prime Number Theorem</h2>
                <p>The Prime Number Theorem describes the asymptotic distribution of prime numbers. It states that the
                    number of primes less than a given number n is approximately equal to n / ln(n), where ln is the
                    natural logarithm.</p>

                <h2>Euclid's Theorem</h2>
                <p>Euclid's theorem asserts that there are infinitely many prime numbers. The proof involves assuming a
                    finite number of primes and deriving a contradiction by constructing a new prime not in the assumed
                    list.</p>

                <h2>Goldbach's Conjecture</h2>
                <p>This conjecture, proposed by Christian Goldbach, posits that every even integer greater than 2 can be
                    expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. Although it has been checked for large numbers, it
                    remains unproven.</p>

                <h2>Fermat's Little Theorem</h2>
                <p>If p is a prime number and a is an integer not divisible by p, then a^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p). This theorem
                    is useful for checking the primality of numbers and has applications in cryptography.</p>

                <h2>Applications of Prime Numbers</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cryptography:</strong> Prime numbers are crucial in various encryption algorithms, such
                        as RSA, where the security of the system relies on the difficulty of factoring large composite
                        numbers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Computer Science:</strong> Primes are used in hashing algorithms, random number
                        generation, and error detection and correction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mathematics:</strong> Primes are fundamental in various branches of mathematics,
                        influencing fields like algebra, number theory, and analysis.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Open Problems</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Riemann Hypothesis:</strong> This hypothesis, one of the Millennium Prize Problems,
                        conjectures that all non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function have a real part of 1/2. It
                        has profound implications for the distribution of prime numbers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Twin Prime Conjecture:</strong> This conjecture suggests that there are infinitely many
                        twin primes, pairs of primes that differ by 2, such as (11, 13) and (17, 19).</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Prime numbers are a cornerstone of number theory with wide-reaching applications in mathematics and
                    beyond. Their unique properties and intriguing distribution continue to inspire research and
                    discovery.</p>
